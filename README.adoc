= JUnit Characterization Tests

A simple utility for JUnit 4.6+ (`@Rules` required) for working with *characterization tests*

== Characterization tests

A characterization test is a means to describe (characterize) the actual
behavior of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing
behavior of legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. +
This term was coined by Michael Feathers

== Usage

Having a _Legacy Business Object_; assuming a hard to test class

[source, java]
----
package com.example;

public class BusinessClass {

    public String businessMethod(String param) {
        System.out.println("param = " + param);
        final String split = param.split(" ")[0];
        System.out.println("after split = " + split);
        return split;
    }

}
----

We can introduce a Chracterization Test - to capture the log of the class and
later on re-test; to see if the refcatoring impacted the actual output.

[source, java]
----

@RunWith(JUnitParamsRunner.class)
public class BusinessClassTest {

    @ClassRule //<1>
    public static CharacterizationRule rule = new CharacterizationRule(BusinessClassTest.class);

    private BusinessClass service = new BusinessClass();

    @Test
    @FileParameters("classpath:tst.csv")  //<2>
    public void just_run_the_method(String parameter) {
        service.businessMethod(parameter);

    }
}
----
<1> Invoking characterization rule
<2> This is additional junit-params line.

NOTE: The junit extension works only for `@ClassRule`; an output file that gets
generated (or consumed for verification) is named after the classname. Hence running
the CharacterizationRule with `@Rule` attribute doesn't make any sense at the moment.

Initially, to create the master characteristics, the test needs running with
`pinchpoint` property. This turns the rule into a recording mode, when a master
output is created. All subsequent test runs (without a property) will be checking
the output against the master data.

----
mvn -Dpinchpoint=true -Dtest=BusinessClassTest test
----

The default output folder is `target/test-classes`; the file name is the test
class cannonical name, followed with a `txt` extension.

=== JUnit Patams

JUnitParams project adds a new runner to JUnit and provides much easier and
readable parametrised tests for JUnit >=4.6.

TIP: Using https://github.com/Pragmatists/JUnitParams/[junitparams] is not essential,
 nonetheless, a reliable characterization tests makes sense when a significant
 amount of data is pushed through the class in testing

To use JUnitParams, additional dependency is required

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>pl.pragmatists</groupId>
    <artifactId>JUnitParams</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Sample CSV file with parameters for this particular example looks as follows
----
first parameter
second parameter
third parameter
----

A sample output for this example would be
----
param = first parameter
after split = first
param = second parameter
after split = second
param = third parameter
after split = third
----
